// Job search - BuildTime #3

/*
Oggi analizzeremo un problema molto comune: realizzare algoritmi di ricerca.
Il tuo compito è creare un algoritmo che cercherà per posizione lavorativa E posizione geografica.
Ti abbiamo fornito un array chiamato "jobs" in fondo al file, NON modificarlo in alcun modo.
L'algoritmo che devi realizzare cercherà SIA per posizione lavorativa che per posizione geografica.
Prendi queste tre inserzioni ad esempio:

      job1:  location: "NY, US",     position: "java dev"
      job2:  location: "Genoa, IT"   position: "web dev"
      job3:  location: "US"      position: "dev"

Cercando contemporaneamente come posizione lavorativa "dev" e posizione geografica "US", dovresti ottenere come risultato solamente job1 e job3,
in quanto job2 non soddisfa la condizione posta sulla posizione geografica.

REQUISITI:
- il tuo algoritmo deve tornare i risultati nella seguente forma:
{
  result: [], <-- inserisci qui le inserzioni che rispecchiano la posizione lavorativa e la posizione geografica richiesta
  count: 0 <-- inserisci qui il numero totale delle inserzioni trovate
}

- da ogni inserzione trovata, elimina i campi "description", "requirements", "benefits" e "company_profile" per semplificare il risultato

- la tua ricerca deve essere "case insensitive" (non deve essere influenzata da lettere maiuscole o minuscole nelle parole cercate)
*/

// NON MODIFICARE QUESTO ARRAY!
